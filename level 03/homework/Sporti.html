        <h1>Swimming</h1>
        <h3>Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that <br>
            requires the use of one's entire body <br>
            to move through water. <br>
            The sport takes place in pools or<br>
            open water (e.g., in a sea or lake). <br>
            Competitive swimming is one of the most popular <br>
            Olympic sports,with varied distance events in <br>
            butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, <br>
            and individual medley. In addition to <br>
            these individual events, <br>
            four swimmers can take part in either a <br> 
            freestyle or medley relay. <br>
            A medley relay consists of four swimmers <br>
            who will each swim a different stroke, <br>
            ordered as backstroke, breaststroke, <br>
            butterfly and freestyle.<br>
            Swimming each stroke requires a set of <br>
            specific techniques;<br>
            in competition, there are distinct regulations <br>
            concerning the acceptable form for <br>
            each individual stroke. <br>
            There are also regulations on what types of <br>
            swimsuits, caps, jewelry and injury tape that are <br>
            allowed at competitions. <br>
            Although it is possible for competitive swimmers to incur <br>
            several injuries from the sport, <br>
            such as tendinitis in the shoulders or knees, <br>
            there are also multiple health benefits associated <br>
            with the sport.<br>
