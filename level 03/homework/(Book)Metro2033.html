        <h1>Metro 2033</h1>
        <p>Metro 2033 (Russian: Метро 2033) is a 2002 post-apocalyptic 
        <br>fiction novel by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky. It is 
        <br>set within the Moscow Metro, where the last survivors 
        hide <br>after a global nuclear holocaust. It has been followed 
        by <br>two sequels, Metro 2034 and Metro 2035, and spawned the 
        Metro <br>media franchise. The book's English edition 
        was <br>published as a tie-in with its video game adaptation in 
        2010.</p>
        <h1>Background </h1>
        <p>In 2013, a nuclear war forced a large amount of Moscow's 
        <br>surviving population to relocate to the city's Metro 
        system <br>in search of refuge. Eventually, communities 
        settled within <br>the underground train stations and 
        developed into <br>independent states over time. Factions 
        emerged, ranging <br>from the independent peacekeepers the 
        "Rangers of the <br>Order", to the neo-Stalinist Red Line 
        faction and the <br>neo-Nazi Fourth Reich, to the more 
        powerful factions such <br>as Polis, which contained the 
        greatest military power and <br>the most knowledge of the 
        past, and the Hansa regime, which <br>controlled the main 
        ring of metro stations by its sheer <br>economic power.
        <br>As these groups began to evolve, the Red Line and the 
        <br>Fourth Reich quickly entered a state of war, as both 
        sought <br>to destroy the other. As the war raged, the 
        stations who <br>refused to join either side were either 
        demolished by the <br>factions, merged into the Hansa 
        regime, raided by criminal <br>bandits, or formed their own 
        independent states. Other <br>stations were outright 
        destroyed by animals, mutated by the <br>nuclear fallout. 
        While most of the stations were controlled <br>by the three 
        main factions, some stations formed <br>independent 
        alliances, including the station VDNKh <br>(Exhibition). 
        Within that station, the events of Metro 2033 <br>unfold.</p>
