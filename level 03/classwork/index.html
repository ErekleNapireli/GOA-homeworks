<p>Life, it seems, will fade away <br>
    Drifting further, every day <br>
    Getting lost within myself <br>
    Nothing matters, no one else <br>
    I have lost the will to live <br> 
    Simply nothing more to give <br>
    There is nothing more for me <br> 
    Need the end to set me free <br>
    Things not what they used to be <br>
    Missing one inside of me <br>
    Deathly loss, this can't be real <br>
    I cannot stand this hell I feel <br>
    Emptiness is filling me <br>
    To the point of agony <br>
    Growing darkness, taking dawn <br>
    I was me, but now he's gone <br>
    No one but me <br>
    Can save myself <br>
    But it's too late <br>
    Now I can't think <br>
    Think why I should even try <br>
    Yesterday seems as though <br>
    It never existed <br> 
    Death greets me warm <br>
    Now I will just say goodbye <br>
    Bye...</p>
